# Vibe Gaming App â€” Prompt Pack (ChatGPT + Claude, Modular)

A readyâ€‘toâ€‘run set of prompts that generates a complete engineering spec and execution plan for a **mobile online gaming platform (Dominoes, Chess, â€¦)** with a **Go backend** and **Kubernetes/Helm** deployment. Designed for **ChatGPT** to create plans & documents and **Claude** to write/code.

---

## How to Use (Modular Run)
1. **Copy the Variables block** below and edit values as needed. Keep the keys the same.
2. In **ChatGPT** (planner/docs), run **Module 0** once to establish context; then run any of the **Docs Modules (1â€“12)** independently to generate that file.
3. After docs are ready, switch to **Claude** and run the **Coding Kickoff** + **Implementation Modules**.
4. Each module outputs a **single file** and must **start with a filename header** and end with a **selfâ€‘check list**.

---

- Add Makefile(s), dockerfiles, basic Helm chart stubs
- Add CI yaml with build/test/lint
Output:
- A tree view and the content for all created files, chunked across responses if needed.
- Include commands to run locally and expected output.
```

```
Implement REST + WS for lobby and matchmaking per api.md. Include Redis usage for queues, idempotency, and integration tests.
```

## Implementation â€” Flutter UI (Claude)
**Prompt:**
```

```

## Implementation â€” Helm Charts (Claude)
**Prompt:**
```

```

**ADR Template (ChatGPT):**
```
Create an Architecture Decision Record template and sample ADRs for DB choice, WebSockets vs. gRPC, and event bus.

```

---

## Quality Gates (apply to every module)
- Starts with `FILENAME:`
- Assumptions listed; no open questions block progress
- Mermaid diagrams render
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Next Actions with who/which agent owns them

---

## Tips
- If output is long, split logically; keep each file selfâ€‘contained.
- Prefer code snippets over prose when instructive.
- Always link back to prior files to keep cohesion.
